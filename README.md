# ksense-coding-challenge Hayden Johnson

Thank you so much for the opportunity to attempt this development coding challenge.

To view the live version of the project, visit:
https://ksense-coding-challenge-haydenjohnson.vercel.app/

the prompt:
develop a one-page web application that receives JSON data and renders the data into the DOM. You will be using the following API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

You should be able to find the endpoints you need on that page for users, posts, etc.

Using jQuery or vanilla JS you will display each 'USER' in a table. When the user selects a 'USER' in the table, it will display all of the 'POSTS' that were created by that 'USER'.
